# 📁 Assets Folder

This folder contains assets for video editing enhancements.

## Required Assets

### 1. Subscribe Button Image
**File:** `subscribe.png`
**Purpose:** Animated subscribe popup that appears at 30% and 70% of video
**Recommended Size:** 300x100 pixels (or similar)
**Format:** PNG with transparency

**How to create:**
1. Use Canva, Photoshop, or any image editor
2. Create a button with text "SUBSCRIBE" 
3. Make it eye-catching (red background, white text works well)
4. Add an arrow or bell icon
5. Export as PNG with transparent background
6. Save as `assets/subscribe.png`

**Quick option:** Search "subscribe button PNG" online and download a free one

### 2. Subscribe Sound Effect (Optional)
**File:** `subscribe_sound.mp3`
**Purpose:** Sound effect when subscribe popup appears
**Duration:** 1-2 seconds
**Recommended:** Pop, whoosh, or notification sound

**Where to get:**
- Freesound.org
- YouTube Audio Library
- Pixabay
- Or record your own!

## Current Status

- ✅ Background music: `background.mp3` (in root folder)
- ⚠️ Subscribe image: `assets/subscribe.png` (CREATE THIS)
- ⚠️ Subscribe sound: `assets/subscribe_sound.mp3` (OPTIONAL)

## What Happens Without Assets?

The editor will gracefully skip features that need missing assets:

- **No subscribe.png** → Subscribe popup skipped, video still processes
- **No subscribe_sound.mp3** → Popup appears without sound
- **No .srt file** → Subtitles skipped, video still processes

**Your video will still be edited with all other features!**

## Subtitle Files

For subtitles, create a `.srt` file with the same name as your video:

Example: If your video is `Environmental Pollution Video.mp4`, create:
`Environmental Pollution Video.srt`

**SRT Format:**
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to this video about pollution

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today we'll explore environmental issues
```

**Tools to generate SRT:**
- YouTube auto-captions (download and edit)
- Whisper AI (automatic transcription)
- Manual creation in any text editor

**Quick Start:** Create `subscribe.png` and you're good to go! 🚀
