# 🎨 Assets Needed for Full Video Enhancement

You've enabled ALL engagement features! Here's what you need to create:

## ✅ Already Have:
- **Background music** - `background.mp3` in root folder

## ⚠️ Need to Create:

### 1. Subscribe Button Image (IMPORTANT!)
**File:** `assets/subscribe.png`

**Quick Creation Steps:**
1. Go to Canva.com (free)
2. Create 300x100px design
3. Add text "SUBSCRIBE" in bold
4. Use red background (#FF0000)
5. Add white text (#FFFFFF)
6. Optional: Add bell icon or arrow
7. Download as PNG
8. Save to `assets/subscribe.png`

**Or download free:**
- Search "subscribe button PNG transparent" on Google
- Download any you like
- Save as `assets/subscribe.png`

### 2. Subscribe Sound (Optional)
**File:** `assets/subscribe_sound.mp3`

**Where to get:**
- Freesound.org - Search "pop" or "notification"
- YouTube Audio Library - Download any short sound
- Pixabay - Free sound effects

**Recommended sounds:**
- Pop sound
- Whoosh sound
- Bell notification
- Any 1-2 second sound effect

### 3. Subtitle Files (Per Video)
**File:** `VideoName.srt` (same name as your video)

**How to create:**
1. Watch your video
2. Note down what's said and when
3. Create .srt file with timestamps

**Example:** `Environmental Pollution Video.srt`
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Environmental pollution is a growing concern

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
affecting our planet in many ways
```

**Or use AI:**
- Upload video to YouTube (private)
- Download auto-generated captions
- Edit and save as .srt

## What Happens Without These?

**Good news:** The editor will still work!

- ❌ No `subscribe.png` → Subscribe popup skipped
- ❌ No `.srt` file → Subtitles skipped
- ✅ All other features still applied!

Your video will still get:
- ✅ 1.2x speed
- ✅ Silence removal
- ✅ Dynamic zoom
- ✅ Color grading
- ✅ Audio enhancement
- ✅ Background music

---

## Priority Order:

1. **CREATE FIRST:** `assets/subscribe.png` (5 minutes, big impact!)
2. **OPTIONAL:** `assets/subscribe_sound.mp3` (nice to have)
3. **PER VIDEO:** `.srt` subtitle files (for accessibility)

---

## Quick Start Without Assets:

If you want to test now without creating assets:

1. The editor will skip subscribe popup and subtitles
2. All other features will work perfectly
3. Create assets later and re-run for full effect

**Run now:**
```bash
py auto_edit.py --manifest manifest.json --work-dir work
```

**Or:**
```bash
edit_video.bat
```

**TIP:** Create `subscribe.png` once, use it for all videos! 🚀
